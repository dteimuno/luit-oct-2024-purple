## 💡 About the Repo

This repository contains my Python projects and scripts as part of the DevOps Bootcamp. From automation to handling cloud infrastructure, it's all here. You'll find:
- Scripts for automating tasks
- Python utilities for cloud services (AWS, Azure, etc.)
- Practice problems and projects
- Solutions for challenges and assignments

## ⚙️ Technologies
This repo uses the following tools and technologies:
- **Python** (of course!)
- **AWS Boto3** for interacting with cloud services
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation
